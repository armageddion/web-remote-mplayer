# Web Remote MPlayer
==================

This nugget is forked from Nassty/web-remote-mplayer

I have reworked it to suit my own needs which is to simultaneously control three separate instances of itself spread accross separate playback devices. 

### Notes:
`clean` option serves to manually remove .sock file after playback is finished as mplayed fails to do so. 
`nuke` option reboots the system provided that operating user has sufficient privileges.
